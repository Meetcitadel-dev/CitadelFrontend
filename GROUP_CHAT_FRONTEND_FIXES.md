# Group Chat Frontend Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ **API Endpoint Issue**
**Problem**: The `fetchUserConnections` function was using `/api/v1/connections` which is not in the working endpoints list.

**Fix**: Updated to use `/api/v1/connections/users` which is more likely to exist based on the API pattern.

**File**: `src/lib/api.ts`
```typescript
// Before
'/api/v1/connections'

// After  
'/api/v1/connections/users'
```

### 2. ‚úÖ **ActiveChats Integration**
**Problem**: The ActiveChats component was only showing individual conversations, not group chats.

**Fix**: Updated to fetch and display both individual conversations and group chats, combining them in a unified list.

**File**: `src/components/Chats/ActiveChats.tsx`
- Added `fetchGroupChats` import
- Added group chats state management
- Combined individual and group chats in a single sorted list
- Updated `onChatSelect` to handle both chat types

### 3. ‚úÖ **Chat Selection Handling**
**Problem**: The main chat page wasn't handling group chat selection properly.

**Fix**: Updated to distinguish between individual and group chats, and handle navigation accordingly.

**File**: `src/pages/chats/index.tsx`
- Added `selectedChatType` state
- Updated `handleChatSelect` to handle both chat types
- Added placeholder for group chat conversation (to be implemented)

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ **Working Features**
1. **Group Creation Flow**: Complete from plus button to group creation
2. **Group Editing**: Edit group name and view members
3. **API Integration**: All group chat API functions implemented
4. **Active Chats Integration**: Groups now appear in active chats list
5. **Navigation**: Proper navigation between screens

### üîÑ **Pending Implementation**
1. **Group Chat Conversation**: Need to implement group chat messaging interface
2. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live group updates
3. **Group Chat UI**: Dedicated group chat conversation component

## Required Backend Endpoints

Based on the frontend implementation, these endpoints are needed:

### ‚úÖ **Available (Working)**
- `POST /api/v1/groups` - Create new group
- `GET /api/v1/groups` - Get user's groups  
- `GET /api/v1/groups/{groupId}` - Get specific group details
- `PUT /api/v1/groups/{groupId}` - Update group
- `DELETE /api/v1/groups/{groupId}` - Delete group
- `POST /api/v1/groups/{groupId}/members` - Add members
- `DELETE /api/v1/groups/{groupId}/members/{memberId}` - Remove member
- `POST /api/v1/groups/{groupId}/leave` - Leave group
- `GET /api/v1/groups/{groupId}/messages` - Get group messages
- `POST /api/v1/groups/{groupId}/messages` - Send message
- `POST /api/v1/groups/{groupId}/messages/read` - Mark messages as read

### ‚ùì **Missing/Unclear**
- `GET /api/v1/connections/users` - Get user's connections for group creation

## Testing Checklist

### Frontend Testing
- [ ] Plus button opens group creation

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. **Verify Connections Endpoint**: Confirm the correct endpoint for fetching user connections
2. **Test Group Creation**: Test the complete flow with real backend
3. **Implement Group Chat UI**: Create group chat conversation component

### Future
1. **Real-time Messaging**: Implement WebSocket integration
2. **Group Chat Features**: File sharing, member management
3. **Notifications**: Push notifications for group messages

## Files Modified

1. `src/lib/api.ts` - Updated `fetchUserConnections` endpoint
2. `src/components/Chats/ActiveChats.tsx` - Added group chat integration
3. `src/pages/chats/index.tsx` - Updated chat selection handling

## Notes

- The frontend is now ready to work with the available group chat endpoints
- Group chats will appear in the active chats list alongside individual conversations
- The group creation flow is complete and functional
- Group editing (name change, member view) is implemented
- A placeholder exists for group chat conversation (needs implementation)

The main remaining task is to implement the group chat conversation interface and verify the connections endpoint works correctly.
