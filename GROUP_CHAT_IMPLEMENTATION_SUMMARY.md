### 3. ActiveChats & MatchesChats
- **Purpose**: Display existing conversations
- **Key Features**:
  - Pass `onPlusClick` prop to ChatHeader
  - Maintain existing functionality for individual chats

### 4. GroupChatApp (`components/Chats/GroupChats/index.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Main container for group chat functionality
- **Key Features**:
  - Manages navigation between create and edit screens
  - Handles group creation flow
  - Provides callbacks for group events

### 5. CreateGroupScreen (`components/Chats/GroupChats/create-group-screen.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Screen for creating new groups
- **Key Features**:
  - Fetches user connections from API
  - Allows member selection with search
  - Creates group via API call
  - Shows selected members as tags
  - Error handling and loading states

### 6. EditGroupScreen (`components/Chats/GroupChats/edit-group-screen.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Screen for editing group details
- **Key Features**:
  - Fetches group details from API
  - Allows group name editing (admin only)
  - Shows group members list
  - Search functionality for members
  - Group options menu

### 7. Supporting Components
- **ConnectionItem**: Displays connection in create screen
- **MemberItem**: Displays member in edit screen
- **SelectedMember**: Shows selected members as removable tags
- **GroupOptionsMenu**: Context menu for group actions

## API Integration

### New API Functions Added (`lib/api.ts`)
1. `fetchUserConnections()` - Get user's connections for group creation
2. `createGroupChat()` - Create new group
3. `fetchGroupChats()` - Get user's groups
4. `fetchGroupChat()` - Get specific group details
5. `updateGroupChat()` - Update group details
6. `deleteGroupChat()` - Delete group
7. `fetchGroupMessages()` - Get group messages
8. `sendGroupMessage()` - Send message to group
9. `markGroupMessagesAsRead()` - Mark messages as read
10. `addGroupMembers()` - Add members to group
11. `removeGroupMember()` - Remove member from group
12. `leaveGroupChat()` - Leave group

### Type Definitions Added (`types/index.ts`)
- `GroupMember` - Member information
- `GroupChat` - Group details
- `CreateGroupRequest` - Group creation payload
- `UpdateGroupRequest` - Group update payload
- `GroupMessage` - Message structure
- `GroupChatResponse` - API response wrapper
- `GroupMessageResponse` - Message API response wrapper

## User Flow

### 1. Group Creation Flow
1. User clicks plus button in chat header
2. CreateGroupScreen opens
3. User's connections are fetched and displayed
4. User selects members for the group
5. User clicks "Create group"
6. Group is created via API
7. User is redirected to EditGroupScreen
8. Group appears in active chats list

### 2. Group Editing Flow
1. User can edit group name (if admin)
2. User can view all group members
3. User can search through members
4. User can access group options menu
5. Changes are saved via API

### 3. Navigation Flow
- **Back from Create**: Returns to main chat page
- **Back from Edit**: Returns to create screen
- **Group Created**: Returns to main chat page with group in list

## Key Features Implemented

### âœ… Completed Features
1. **Group Creation**: Create groups with selected connections
2. **Member Selection**: Search and select members from connections
3. **Group Editing**: Edit group name and view members
4. **API Integration**: Full backend integration with error handling
5. **Loading States**: Proper loading and error states
6. **Search Functionality**: Search connections and members
7. **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile and desktop
8. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration

### ðŸ”„ Future Enhancements
1. **Group Chat Messages**: Send and receive messages in groups
2. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live updates
3. **File Sharing**: Support for images and files
4. **Group Avatars**: Custom group profile pictures
5. **Member Management**: Add/remove members from edit screen
6. **Group Notifications**: Push notifications for group messages

## Backend Requirements

A comprehensive backend requirements document has been created (`GROUP_CHAT_BACKEND_REQUIREMENTS.md`) that includes:

1. **Database Schema**: Tables for groups, members, messages, and read status
2. **API Endpoints**: Complete REST API specification
3. **Business Logic**: Rules for group creation, membership, and permissions
4. **Real-time Features**: WebSocket event specifications
5. **Security Considerations**: Authentication, authorization, and validation
6. **Performance Considerations**: Pagination, caching, and optimization
7. **Error Handling**: Standardized error responses
8. **Testing Requirements**: Unit, integration, and load testing

## Integration Points

### With Existing Chat System
- Group chats appear in the "Active" tab alongside individual chats
- Same navigation structure and styling
- Consistent user experience

### With Connection System
- Groups can only be created with existing connections
- Leverages existing connection data and API

### With Authentication
- All group operations require valid authentication
- User permissions are enforced

## Testing Considerations

### Frontend Testing
1. **Component Testing**: Test each component in isolation
2. **Integration Testing**: Test component interactions
3. **User Flow Testing**: Test complete group creation flow
4. **Error Handling**: Test error states and edge cases

### Backend Testing
1. **API Testing**: Test all endpoints with various scenarios
2. **Permission Testing**: Test admin vs member permissions
3. **Data Validation**: Test input validation and sanitization
4. **Performance Testing**: Test with multiple concurrent users

## Deployment Notes

1. **Database Migration**: New tables need to be created
2. **API Deployment**: New endpoints need to be deployed
3. **Frontend Deployment**: Updated components need to be deployed
4. **Environment Variables**: Configure API endpoints and WebSocket URLs
5. **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring for group chat activity

## Conclusion

The group chat functionality has been successfully implemented with a clean, modular architecture that integrates seamlessly with the existing chat system. The implementation includes proper error handling, loading states, and type safety. The backend requirements document provides a complete specification for implementing the server-side functionality.

The system is ready for backend implementation and can be easily extended with additional features like real-time messaging, file sharing, and advanced group management options.
